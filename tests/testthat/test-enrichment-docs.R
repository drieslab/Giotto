# Documentation consistency for the two signature-based families.
#
# These assert the *property*, derived from the installed help database, rather
# than a fixed list of topics -- so a function added to either family later is
# held to the same rules without anyone remembering to update a test.
#
# What went wrong before these existed: all nine titles were the function name
# repeated, `@param name` was missing its first word in four places so
# `?runRankEnrich` rendered "name: to give to spatial enrichment results",
# `runSpatialEnrich` documented a default it does not have, and thirteen shared
# parameters carried between two and five descriptions each.

# Works both ways: against the installed package's Rd database when there is
# one (R CMD check), and against the source tree's man/ when there is not
# (devtools::load_all + test_file, where nothing has been installed).
