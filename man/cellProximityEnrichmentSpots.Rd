\value{
List of cell Proximity scores (CPscores) in data.table format. The first
data.table (raw_sim_table) shows the raw observations of both the original and
simulated networks. The second data.table (enrichm_res) shows the enrichment results.
}
\description{
Compute cell-cell interaction enrichment for spots (observed vs expected)
}
\details{
Spatial proximity enrichment or depletion between pairs of cell types
is calculated by calculating the observed over the expected frequency
of cell-cell proximity interactions. The expected frequency is the average frequency
calculated from a number of spatial network simulations. Each individual simulation is
obtained by reshuffling the cell type labels of each node (spot)
in the spatial network.
