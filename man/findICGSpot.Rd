\description{
Identifies cell-to-cell Interaction Changed Genes (ICG) for spots,
i.e. genes expression residual that are differentially due to proximity to other cell types.
}
\details{
Function to calculate if genes expreesion residual are differentially expressed in cell types
 when they interact (approximated by physical proximity) with other cell types.
 Gene expression residual calculated as: 
 (observed expression in spot - cell_type_proportion * average_expressed_in_cell_type)
 The results data.table in the cpgObject contains - at least - the following columns:
\itemize{
 \item{genes:}{ All or selected list of tested genes}
 \item{sel:}{ average gene expression residual in the interacting cells from the target cell type }
 \item{other:}{ average gene expression residual in the NOT-interacting cells from the target cell type }
 \item{pcc_sel:}{ correlation between cell proximity score and expression residual in the interacting cells from the target cell type}
 \item{pcc_other:}{ correlation between cell proximity score and expression residual in the NOT-interacting cells from the target cell type }
 \item{pcc_diff:}{ correlation difference between sel and other}
 \item{p.value:}{ associated p-value}
 \item{p.adj:}{ adjusted p-value}
 \item{cell_type:}{ target cell type}
 \item{int_cell_type:}{ interacting cell type}
 \item{nr_select:}{ number of cells for selected target cell type}
 \item{int_nr_select:}{ number of cells for interacting cell type}
 \item{unif_int:}{ cell-cell interaction}
}
