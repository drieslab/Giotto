\description{
Giotto import functionalities for Xenium datasets. This function creates a
`XeniumReader` instance that has convenient reader functions for converting
individual pieces of Xenium data into Giotto-compatible representations.

These functions should have all param values provided as defaults, but
can be flexibly modified to do things such as look in alternative
directories or paths
