# Giotto

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The Giotto package consists of two modules, Giotto Analyzer and Viewer
(see [www.spatialgiotto.com](http://www.spatialgiotto.com)), which
provide tools to process, analyze and visualize **single-cell spatial
expression** data. The underlying framework is generalizable to
virtually all currently available spatial datasets. We recently
demonstrated the general applicability on 10 different datasets created
by 9 different state-of-the-art spatial technologies, including *in
situ* hybridization (seqFISH+, merFISH, osmFISH), sequencing (Slide-seq,
Visium, STARmap) and imaging-based multiplexing/proteomics (CyCIF, MIBI,
CODEX). These technologies differ in terms of resolution (single cell vs
multiple cells), spatial dimension (2D vs 3D), molecular modality
(protein vs RNA), and throughput (number of cells and genes). More
information and documentation about the latest version of Giotto
Analyzer can be found at <https://rubd.github.io/Giotto_site/> (**URL
