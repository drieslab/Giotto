# 1. How to create a Giotto Object

In this tutorial, the methodology and syntax to create a `giotto` object is shown and osmFISH data is used throughout the tutorial.

## 1.1 Import Giotto and Download the Data

To download this data, please ensure that [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/?) is installed locally.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(Giotto)

genv_exists = checkGiottoEnvironment()
if(!genv_exists){
  # The following command need only be run once to install the Giotto environment.
  installGiottoEnvironment()
}

# Specify path from which data may be retrieved/stored
data_directory = paste0(getwd(),'/gobject_data/')
# alternatively, "/path/to/where/the/data/lives/"

# Specify path to which results may be saved
results_directory = paste0(getwd(),'/gobject_results/') 
# alternatively, "/path/to/store/the/results/"

# Download osmFISH dataset to data_directory
getSpatialDataset(dataset = 'osmfish_SS_cortex', directory = data_directory, method = 'wget')
```


## 1.2 Minimum requirements for a Giotto Object

- Expression matrix
- Spatial locations (*unnecessary for scRNAseq analysis*)

Here, creating a `giotto` object with the minimum requirements is shown in two examples. Data formatting guidelines are shown below this code block.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Example 1.
# Create a Giotto object using data directly from file paths 
osm_exprs = paste0(data_directory, "osmFISH_prep_expression.txt")
osm_locs = paste0(data_directory, "osmFISH_prep_cell_coordinates.txt")

minimum_gobject1 = createGiottoObject(expression = osm_exprs,
                                      spatial_locs = osm_locs)

# Example 2.
# Create a Giotto object using objects already loaded into workspace
expression_matrix = readExprMatrix(path = osm_exprs) # fast method to read expression matrix
cell_locations = data.table::fread(file = osm_locs)

minimum_gobject2 = createGiottoObject(expression = expression_matrix,
                                      spatial_locs = cell_locations)
```



Expression file formatting


Expression count matrices accepted by *Giotto* should have columns correlating to individual cells (**cell IDs**) and rows to individual features (**feature IDs**).

**data.table** objects and text-based files ie: (**.csv, .tsv, .txt**) to be read in should have column 1 be **feature IDs**.

**matrix** and **DelayedMatrix** objects should have **feature IDs**
already incorporated as the rownames.



Locations file formatting


Numerical columns will be interpreted in order of x, y, and (optionally) z coordinate. The first non-numerical column will be taken as **cell IDs**


**\*Note:** multiple expression files during can be given at once during Giotto object creation by using a named list.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Arbitrary modifications
scaled_matrix = expression_matrix * 1.2
custom_matrix = expression_matrix * 0.5

# Provide multiple expression matrices at once to the Giotto Object
# If these matrices are stored in files rather than in the workspace,
# file paths may be provided instead of variables
multi_expr_gobject = createGiottoObject(expression = list(raw = expression_matrix,
                                                          scaled = scaled_matrix,
                                                          custom = custom_matrix),
                                        spatial_locs = cell_locations)
```


## 1.3 Customizing the Giotto Object

By providing values to other `createGiottoObject()` parameters, it is possible to add:

- **Cell** or **feature (gene) metadata**: see
    [addCellMetadata](../reference/addCellMetadata.html) and
    [addFeatMetadata](../reference/addFeatMetadata.html)
- **Spatial networks** or **grids**: see
    [Visualizations](./Visualizations.html)
- **Dimension reduction**: see
    [Clustering](./dimension_reduction.html)
- **Images**: see [Imaging](./getting_started_images.html)
- **giottoInstructions**: see
    [createGiottoInstructions](../docs/reference/createGiottoInstructions.html) and below

Providing `giottoInstructions` allows the specification of:

- An alternative python path if using the Giotto Environment (default) is not desired
- A directory to which resulting plots will save
- Plot formatting

`createGiottoInstruction()` is used to create the instructions that are provided to `createGiottoObject()`. The `instructions()` function can then be used to view, set, or modify one or more of these instructions after they have been added to a `giotto` object.

Here is an example of a more customized Giotto object.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Specify data with file paths 
osm_exprs = paste0(data_directory, "osmFISH_prep_expression.txt")
osm_locs = paste0(data_directory, "osmFISH_prep_cell_coordinates.txt")
meta_path = paste0(data_directory, "osmFISH_prep_cell_metadata.txt")

# Create instructions

# Optional: Specify a path to a Python executable within a conda or miniconda 
# environment. If set to NULL (default), the Python executable within the previously
# installed Giotto environment will be used.
my_python_path = NULL # alternatively, "/local/python/path/python" if desired.

instrs = createGiottoInstructions(python_path = my_python_path,
                                  save_dir = results_directory,
                                  plot_format = 'png',
                                  dpi = 200,
                                  height = 9,
                                  width = 9)

# Create Giotto object
custom_gobject = createGiottoObject(expression = osm_exprs,
                                    spatial_locs = osm_locs,                                      
                                    instructions = instrs)

# Add field annotations as cell metadata
metadata = data.table::fread(file = meta_path)
custom_gobject = addCellMetadata(custom_gobject, 
                                 new_metadata = metadata,
                                 by_column = T, 
                                 column_cell_ID = 'CellID')

# Show the Giotto instructions associated with the Giotto object
instructions(custom_gobject)
```


Note that although parameters `show_plot`, `return_plot`, and `save_plot` were not specified within the call to `createGiottoInstructions()`, default values were provided to these instruction parameters. All instruction parameters have default values, such that `createGiottoInstructions()` may be called with some or no arguments yet all instruction parameters will have a value after its execution.

Alternatively, a named list may also be provided to the `instructions` argument of `createGiottoObject()`. However, ensure that all arguments to ` `createGiottoInstructions() ` are defined when providing instructions as a named list, since default values are only applied to instructions when made with createGiottoInstructions() \*Note that `python_path` must be specified when providing instructions as a named list, and may not be provided as NULL.

The `giottoInstructions` may be changed, or completely replaced:


```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Change a specific previously set parameter, e.g. change dpi = 200 to dpi = 300
instructions(custom_gobject, 'dpi') = 300

# Observe that the instructions have changed
instructions(custom_gobject, 'dpi')

# Create new instructions using a named list
sub_results_directory = paste0(results_directory, 'specific_results/')
my_python_path = instructions(custom_gobject, 'python_path')
new_instrs = list(python_path = my_python_path,
                  show_plot = TRUE,
                  return_plot = FALSE,
                  save_plot = TRUE,
                  save_dir = sub_results_directory,
                  plot_format = 'jpg',
                  dpi = 250,
                  units = 'in',
                  height = 12,
                  width = 12,
                  is_docker = FALSE)

# Change all instructions
instructions(custom_gobject) = new_instrs

# Observe that the instructions have changed
instructions(custom_gobject)
```


### 1.3.1 Active spatial unit and feature type

Many of *Giotto*'s functions have `spat_unit` and `feat_type` parameters that govern which set of data to use. The active spatial unit and feature type is visible when directly returning the `giotto` object and decides what defaults are used when those parameters are not supplied.

This setting is also stored within `giottoInstructions` and there are convenient accessors specific for those two settings:

- `activeSpatUnit()`
- `activeFeatType()`

## 1.4 Plotting Data from a Giotto Object

Each plotting function in Giotto has three important binary parameters:

- `show_plot`: print the plot to the console, default is TRUE
- `return_plot`: return the plot as an object, default is TRUE
- `save_plot`: automatically save the plot, default is FALSE

These parameters are stored within a `giotto` object that was provided instructions from `createGiottoInstructions()` and are provided to plotting functions accordingly. To change these parameters from the default values, the instructions may be changed or replaced, or these parameters may be *manually overwritten* within plotting functions.

See `showSaveParameters()` and the `Saving
Options` tutorial for alternative methods to save plots.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Plot according to Giotto Instructions (default)
spatPlot(custom_gobject)

# Plot clusters, create, and save to a new subdirectory, all while overwriting formatting
spatPlot(custom_gobject, 
         cell_color = 'ClusterName', 
         save_plot = TRUE,
         return_plot = TRUE,
         show_plot = TRUE,
         save_param = list(save_folder = 'plots/', # Create subdirectory
                           save_name = 'cell_clusters', 
                           save_format = 'png', 
                           units = 'in',
                           base_height = 9,
                           base_width = 9))
```
