# Giotto 4.2.4 (in development)

## Bug fixes
* `cellProximityHeatmap()` no longer adds `first_type` and `second_type` columns to the caller's own `CPscore$enrichm_res`. `data.table`'s `:=` modifies in place, so the input object was being mutated as a side effect of plotting it.
* `cellProximityHeatmap()` defaults to a diverging palette centred on zero. Enrichment is a diverging quantity whose neutral point is 0; ComplexHeatmap's default is a sequential ramp fitted to the data range, which put the neutral colour wherever the data happened to sit and made depletion hard to distinguish from weak enrichment. `color_breaks`/`color_names` are unchanged.
* `cellProximityNetwork()` draws node points before node labels. Reversed, every label was rendered underneath its own node.
* `cellProximityBarplot()` encodes significance as bar outline weight, so a pair that just cleared the threshold no longer looks identical to one that cleared it by orders of magnitude, and uses an explicit palette rather than ggplot2 defaults.
* `createGiottoXeniumObject()` no longer errors on Xenium-format directories that ship no panel json; feature metadata is generated from the expression matrix when the panel is absent.

## Breaking changes
* `cellProximityEnrichment()` now permutes cell type labels over the **nodes** of the spatial network, so every cell carries one label across all of its edges. Previously it pooled the two endpoint cell-type columns into one vector and reshuffled that, which draws labels degree-weighted and lets a cell take different labels on different edges — never the node permutation the documentation described. The expected counts that produced deviate from the exact node-permutation expectation by up to 13% on the mini Visium leiden labels, and by 50% when cell type tracks node degree. **Enrichment scores and p-values will differ from previous releases**, and there is no option to restore the old null. Observed counts are unchanged. Empirical p-values now use the unbiased `(1 + n) / (1 + number_of_simulations)` estimator and can no longer be exactly zero, which the `PI_value` formula previously had to work around. The simulation no longer materializes a `number_of_simulations x n_edges` table: at 50,000 cells this is ~13x faster and ~4x lower peak memory, and the function now runs at 170,000 cells where it previously exhausted memory. `enrichm_res` gains `sd_sim` and `z`; every existing column keeps its name, class and position, so `cellProximityBarplot()`, `cellProximityHeatmap()` and `cellProximityNetwork()` are unaffected. `cellProximityEnrichmentSpots()` is unchanged and still uses the old helper.
* `findScranMarkers_one_vs_all()` returns `cluster` as **character**. All `findMarkers_one_vs_all()` methods now agree on the type, so their results can be joined or stacked on `cluster` regardless of `method`; previously scran disagreed with gini. Code comparing against a numeric literal needs `"3"` rather than `3`. Note that `method = "mast"` labels the comparison (`"3_vs_others"`) rather than the bare cluster id, so joins across mast and the others still need a translation step.
* `calculateHVF(method = "var_p_resid")` now computes analytic Pearson residuals itself, from **raw counts**, instead of taking the plain variance of whatever matrix it was handed. **Selected features will differ from previous releases.** Previously the residual criterion required running `normalizeGiotto(norm_methods = "pearson_resid")` first *and* passing `expression_values = "scaled"` (the slot that normalization writes to, not the `"normalized"` default) — a three-way agreement nothing verified, and which silently returned the variance of library-normalized values whenever it was not met. `expression_values` is now ignored for this method, with a warning if it was set explicitly. `normalizeGiotto(norm_methods = "pearson_resid")` is unaffected and remains available for producing residuals as a stored matrix.
* `analyzeData(x, varParam)` correspondingly returns the residual variance, and gained a `mean_expr` column. It gains a `theta` parameter (default `100`, following Lause/Kobak and matching `normalizeGiotto()`); `calculateHVF()` exposes the same argument. `IterableMatrix` (BPCells) input now errors rather than silently returning a different statistic.
* `calculateHVF()` gains `n_top_feats` (default `2000`), a top-N cut that applies to **all three** methods, combined with each method's own threshold so the more restrictive one decides. `var_number` is deprecated in favour of it — the old name implied variance and the cut is now method-agnostic. Each method ranks on its own score: residual variance, within-bin COV z-score, or COV above the LOESS fit. For `cov_groups` the z-score is standardised within expression bins, so a global ranking stays balanced across expression levels (a top-2000 cut on a Stereo-seq transcriptome drew 9.6-12.4% from each of 19 of 20 bins; the highest-expression bin is under-represented because COV is compressed there by construction). In practice only `cov_loess` changes at the default — 6,043 features selected before, 2,000 now — since `cov_groups`'s `zscore_threshold` is already stricter than the count.
* `calculateHVF(method = "var_p_resid")` selection defaults change to `n_top_feats = 2000` (was no count) and `var_threshold = 1` (was `1.5`), and the two are now applied **together** rather than the count overriding the threshold. The more restrictive constraint decides; passing `NULL` to either falls back to the other. The old defaults selected on variance alone at a cut that sits essentially at the median of the corrected distribution — measured 1.496 on a Stereo-seq cellbin sample, where `1.5` took 9,696 of 19,558 features. `var_threshold = 1` is now a noise floor (under Pearson residuals variance 1 is the no-signal expectation) rather than a selector, and `var_number` sets the size. On a targeted panel, where `var_number` cannot bind — Xenium's 528 features — the floor is what applies, keeping the 433 above noise.
* `findScranMarkers_one_vs_all()`'s `logFC` threshold now takes effect. The filter read `logFC >= logFC`, where both sides resolved to the result column rather than the argument, so the comparison was always `TRUE` and the threshold was silently ignored — features were kept on `pval` and `min_feats` alone. **Fewer features will be returned than in previous releases**; pass `logFC = -Inf` to restore the old behaviour exactly (`logFC = 0` is *not* equivalent — it still drops down-regulated features, which the broken comparison kept).
* All Leiden entry points now default to `n_iterations = 20`: `doLeidenCluster()`, `doLeidenClusterIgraph()`, `doLeidenClusterPython()`, `subClusterCells()` (was `1000`) and `doLeidenSubCluster()` (was `500`). Measured ARI 0.97 against the 1000-iteration partition on a 159k-cell Xenium dataset, at ~50x the speed. **Cluster IDs will differ from previous releases**; pass `n_iterations = 1000` to restore the old behaviour.
* `runUMAP()` gained size-adaptive `n_epochs` and `init`, both now defaulting to `NULL`. Above 50,000 observations they resolve to `200` and `"pca"`; below it to uwot's own `n_epochs` default and `"spectral"`. A PCA init benchmarked both tighter and faster than a random or spectral init at that scale. Passing either explicitly overrides the adaptation. `n_epochs` was previously a fixed `400`. **Embeddings above 50,000 observations will differ from previous releases.** `runUMAPprojection()` and `runIntegratedUMAP()` are unchanged and still use `spread = 5, min_dist = 0.01`.
* `runUMAP()` now uses `uwot::umap2()` instead of `uwot::umap()`. `umap2()` is the same algorithm with a faster approximate nearest-neighbor backend selected automatically, and it threads the optimizer when `batch = TRUE`. Pass `method = "umap"` to restore the previous engine.
* `runUMAP()` defaults retuned to match the benchmarked streaming pipeline: `min_dist` `0.01` -> `0.05`, `spread` `5` -> `1`, and a new `batch = TRUE` argument (was `FALSE`). `min_dist` and `spread` are changed together because uwot fits the embedding's `a`/`b` curve from the pair. `batch = TRUE` is also what lets `umap2()` thread the optimizer. **Embeddings will differ from previous releases**; `min_dist = 0.01, spread = 5, init = "spectral", n_epochs = 400, batch = FALSE` restores the old shape. `n_neighbors` is unchanged at `40`.

## Changes
* `createGiottoXeniumObject()` reads `ome.tif` morphology images directly and no longer converts them through python, so no `tif_exports/` directory is written next to the data. A converted tif left by an earlier run is still used if present. JPEG-2000 images, which is what 10x actually ships, are read through a GDAL VRT rather than decoded up front.
* gini `min_expr_gini_score` and `min_det_gini_score` renamed `min_expression` and `min_detection` — they gate mean expression and detection fraction, not the gini coefficients. Old names deprecated. [#1238](https://github.com/drieslab/Giotto/pull/1238) by eryuluts

## New
* `plotMotifEnrichment()`, `plotMotifGlyphs()` and `spatMotifPlot()` visualize motif results. The triage plot deliberately defaults to effect size against occurrence count rather than a volcano: permutation p-values are floored at `1 / (n_perm + 1)`, so on a real run most significant classes sit exactly on that floor and a volcano's y-axis collapses to a single uninformative line. `style = "volcano"` keeps the conventional view. `plotMotifGlyphs()` draws each motif as the little graph it is, nodes coloured by cell type in canonical slot order, which makes an id like `size4_paw_A-B-B-C` readable at a glance. `spatMotifPlot()` shows where a motif's occurrences sit in the tissue, switching to a density surface above `density_threshold` cells so it stays legible on a large section.
* `cellProximityMotifs()` extends cell-cell interaction analysis from pairs to **multicellular motifs** -- recurrent arrangements of 3 or 4 neighbouring cells, distinguished by shape as well as composition, so a triangle of three cell types is a different motif from a chain of the same three. Alongside the usual label-permutation null it offers a **conditional** null that holds the observed pairwise composition fixed: under the ordinary null any motif built from an attracting pair looks enriched, and the conditional null is what separates a real higher-order niche from an echo of the pairwise signal. Results carry both tails (`p_enrich`, `p_deplete`), an effect size, and `topology` plus a `color_tuple` list column whose positions are structural roles rather than a sort, so `A-B-B` and `B-A-A` stay distinct.
* The motif engine is a pluggable backend rather than a fixed dependency. `motifParam` is a VIRTUAL `analyzeParam` subclass defining the contract and `smotifParam` is one implementation, the same arrangement `pcaParam` has where GiottoDisk contributes `gramEigenPcaParam` from outside the package. A second engine is a new concrete subclass plus its own `analyzeData` method, contributable from another package with no change to Giotto; a test attaches one to prove it. Requires \pkg{smotif} (`Suggests`), whose Rust backend is what makes size 4 tractable at scale.
* `importAtera()` and `createGiottoAteraObject()` read Atera output. `AteraReader` subclasses `XeniumReader` — the layouts are identical today, so it overrides only the platform label and inherits the rest, including `backend =`.
* `importStereoSeq()`, `createGiottoStereoSeqObjectBin()` and `createGiottoStereoSeqObjectCell()` gained a `backend =` argument. When set to a `gsource` project backend it routes to `GiottoDisk::importStereoSeqDisk()`, so a Stereo-seq object can be created as a managed on-disk project with expression held in a `parquetExprStore` instead of memory — mirroring what `createGiottoXeniumObject()` already did. `backend = NULL` (the default) is a no-op and leaves the in-memory path byte-identical. Requires a GiottoDisk carrying the matching GEF reader fixes.
* `.stereoseq_build_polygons_from_border()` now populates `giottoPolygon@unique_ID_cache`, as every other polygon constructor does. This is the one change visible on the in-memory path; the cached value equals `unique(poly_ID)` and `spatIDs()` is unaffected. Left unset, adding cellBorder polygons to a backend-managed `giotto` failed, because `setGiotto()` has by then swapped the `SpatVector` for a `parquetGeomStore` and the ID recompute calls `unique()` on it.
* The `method = "var_p_resid"` diagnostic plot is now decision-support rather than a bare scatter: a reference line at `var = 1` (the no-signal expectation for Pearson residuals, so the value the threshold is relative to), a line at the active `var_threshold`, a log10 y-axis so the elbow in a heavy-tailed distribution is visible, and a second panel of mean expression against residual variance. That panel is the check that selection is not tracking expression level, which is what Pearson residuals exist to avoid. The second panel needs \pkg{patchwork}; without it the rank view is returned alone.
* `RcppHNSW` and `rnndescent` added to `Suggests`. Either one accelerates the `runUMAP()` neighbor search; without them uwot falls back to Annoy. `RcppHNSW` is preferred for dense input with a euclidean, cosine or correlation metric (the usual `runUMAP()` case), while `rnndescent` covers sparse input and metrics HNSW does not support. Installing `rnndescent` is **required** to run `runUMAP(dim_reduction_to_use = NULL)` on a sparse expression matrix.
* gini `min_expression_gini` and `min_detection_gini` gate the gini coefficients themselves, defaulting to `-Inf`. [#1238](https://github.com/drieslab/Giotto/pull/1238) by eryuluts
* gini `min_length` pads the per-cluster vector so coefficients compare across runs with different cluster counts. Defaults to `0`, no padding. Replaces the unused `extended_gini_fun()`.
* `analyzeData(x, featStatsParam)` gained `groups` and `stats`, giving per-(feature, group) statistics from one pass. Group means are a pseudobulk matrix and mean plus percent-detected is dot plot input. `groups` may be named or factored by `cell_ID`, which is the only form that cannot be misaligned; an unnamed vector is still positional, with a warning.
* gini coefficients are taken over all features in one vectorized pass instead of one call per feature — 32x faster at 4000 features x 20 groups, cutting the scoring step 0.31s -> 0.18s. Results are bit-identical. Gini marker detection now errors on fewer than 2 groups, where it previously failed inside `mygini_fun()`.
* `markersParam(method = "gini")` and `analyzeData(x, giniMarkersParam)` expose gini marker detection as a verb, and now hold the machinery — `findGiniMarkers()` and `findGiniMarkers_one_vs_all()` are thin wrappers that fetch expression and a grouping. Dispatches on `ANY` because it is derived entirely from `featStatsParam`, so any backend implementing that statistic supplies gini markers with no code of its own.
* gini markers and ligand-receptor scoring now run on that verb, so both work on disk-backed expression. `findGiniMarkers_one_vs_all()` takes one grouped pass instead of one per cluster (8.9s -> 4.2s at 4000 features x 12000 cells x 20 clusters).

## Bug fixes
* gini markers, `findScranMarkers()`, `findScranMarkers_one_vs_all()` and ligand-receptor scoring now match cluster labels to expression columns by `cell_ID`. Expression and cell metadata are fetched independently and are not guaranteed to share a cell order, so statistics were taken over mislabelled cells — none of the 624 cells of `GiottoData::loadGiottoMini("visium")` are in matching position, and only 1 of 70 top-10 scran markers agreed with the correctly labelled run. **Results will change for affected objects**; they were wrong before.
* gini `rank_score` now takes effect. It compared against a rescaled rank capped at 1, and `findMarkers_one_vs_all()` never forwarded it. Default `1` -> `Inf` keeps results unchanged.
* gini `expression_rank` and `detection_rank` now hold ranks, not the `[1, 0.1]` weight behind `comb_score`. Row counts and `comb_score` unchanged.
